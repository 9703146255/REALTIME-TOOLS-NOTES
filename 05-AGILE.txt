a) Backlog Grooming
====================

Note: After identifying pending works we will create stories in jira (story means task).

-> For every story we will assign story points.

Note: Story points represents duration to complete story.

			3 points ---> 8 hours to complete (1 day)

			5 points ---> 16 hours to complete (2 days)

			8 points ---> 24 hours to complete (3 days)

b) Sprint Planning[MEETING]
----------------------------

-> Sprint Planning meeting is used to prioritize backlog stories.[TAKE HIGH PRIORITY TASK[PRIORITAIZE]]

-> Once prioritization completed then sprint will be started.

			Sprint Duration : 2 weeks (10 working days)



 Scrum Call

Note: In scrum call, every team member "should give work status update.""

		What you are doing today ?

		When it will be completed ?

		Do u have any issues ?
